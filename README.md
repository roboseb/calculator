# calculator
The Odin Project calculator project.

For extra credit, this calculator take decimals, has a backspace, takes keyboard support and dare I say even looks nice. In addition there is a welcome screen with a randomly chosen message. This is intended to be as obnoxious as  possible, but it can be clicked away. There are also a handful of easter eggs included, see if you can find them all without looking at the code first!

DEVLOG/JOURNAL

Man, this took me a crazy amount of time to make compared to what it could have taken. It all started with the stupid pumpkin in the corner, and pretty quickly I was in a mad spiral of adding features (read: "gimmicks"). As of writing this I am probably still going to clean it up a bit as it's not quite ideal visually yet. I think I can excuse some portion of the sloppy code this was made with by blaming it on all the new techniques I learned simultaneously to put this together. Pretty sure this was intended to be a difficult project, but I somehow managed to make it as unnecessarily complex as possible. Hopefully this will be time well spent in the grand scheme of things.

Also, I took a few months long break between the CSS/HTML portion of Foundations and the Javascript part. I'm fairly certain that I forgot most of what I had learned in that time as any CSS dimensions are hard-coded in exclusively,
and that sure looks bad and was a nightmare to build.
